# Better Yelp #

A Project for COMS W4170 UI Design - using the Yelp API to create a more
enjoyable bookmarking experience.

## Source organization ##

Documents are separated into the application (www) and reference info (docs)

## Viewing the Application ##

You can view a running demo at
[jrbalsano.github.com/betteryelp](http://jrbalsano.github.com/betteryelp).

Alternatively, you can clone the source file and run it locally by opening the 
breadcrumbs.html file in Chrome after opening chrome with the following 
command:

```
#mac
open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-files
```

For other OSes, chrome will require the same flags but will be called under a
slightly different convention.
