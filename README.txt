Better Yelp

A Project for COMS W4170 by Yanyi, Mark, Jonathan, and Logan

Documents are separated into the application (www) and reference info (docs)

Leave a terminal tab open to compile the coffeescript, by running the following
command in the www directory:

  coffee -o js/ -cw coffee/

Also, for consistency, please change your text editor to use two spaces as an indent
